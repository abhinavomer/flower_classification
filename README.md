# Flower Recognition App

## Overview

The Flower Recognition App is an interactive web application that allows users to upload images of flowers and predicts their species using a pre-trained deep learning model. Users can upload an image of a flower, and the application will predict the flower species along with a confidence score.

## Features

- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images of flowers directly to the application.
- **Prediction**: The application uses a pre-trained deep learning model to predict the species of the flower in the uploaded image.
- **Output Display**: The predicted flower species and confidence score are displayed to the user.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: An open-source Python library used for building interactive web applications.
- **NumPy**: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python used for numerical operations.
- **PIL (Python Imaging Library)**: A library for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats.
- **TensorFlow**: An open-source machine learning framework for building and deploying machine learning models.

## Usage

1. **Upload Image**: Click on the "Upload Image" button to select and upload an image of a flower.
2. **Prediction**: After uploading the image, click the "Submit" button to predict the species of the flower.
3. **View Prediction**: The application will display the predicted flower species along with the confidence score.

## Supported Flower Species

The Flower Recognition App supports the recognition of the following flower species:

- Daisy
- Dandelion
- Rose
